Even if the team has done these for years, some reminders are still helpful to hear at the start of a Health Monitor. Here are a few suggestion: Individual names will be scrubbed before making the results of this Health Monitor public. Honesty is key. There are no right or wrong answers. Everyone's opinion is valid. Focus on observations and resist the temptation to solve problems while going through the attributes The purpose of the Health Monitor is to help the team, not to compare teams with one another. A lot of us belong to many different teams, for this exercise, focus on this team, the team doing the Health Monitor, when responding.If the team had follow-up items from a previous Health Monitor, review those first. Run a practice voting round to make sure that everyone understands how to vote by tapping the space bar while hovering over the card that they'd like to vote on. Save at least 10 minutes at the end to ensure that there is time to discuss next steps. Ask clarifying questions. When coming up with next steps, try to identify an owner and agree to a target date for the action items. If you're doing the Health Monitor in person in an office, make sure that you have a suitable space set up (e.g., consider size, privacy, and wi-fi).
